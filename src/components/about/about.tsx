                    Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer located in Vienna. I have a passion to bring technical requirements to life since 2011.<br/>
                    Performance and usability without sacrificing creativity is my priority number one.<br/><br/>

                    I would describe myself as well-organised, focused on problem solving, attention to detail.<br/>
                    After work I do a lot of sports, learning new stuff and play video games.
