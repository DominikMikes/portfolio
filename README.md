# Welcome to my portfolio on github

## About myself:
Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer located in Vienna. I have a passion to bring technical requirements to life since 2011.
Performance and usability without sacrificing creativity, is my priority number one.

I would describe myself as well-organised, focused on problem solving, with a special attention to detail person.
After work I do a lot of sports, learning new stuff and play video games.
